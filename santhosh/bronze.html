            <h2>Product History</h2>
            <p>"Bronze, an alloy primarily consisting of copper and tin, has played a significant role in human history due to its durability, versatility, and wide range of applications. Here's a brief overview of the history of bronze:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Early Development: The Bronze Age, a period in human history characterized by the widespread use of bronze, began around 3300 BCE in various parts of the world, including Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, and China. During this time, people learned to alloy copper with tin or other metals to create bronze, which was much stronger and more durable than pure copper.</li>
                <li>Advantages of Bronze: Bronze offered several advantages over other materials of the time, such as stone and wood. It could be easily cast into intricate shapes, making it suitable for tools, weapons, and art. Bronze tools were more efficient and longer-lasting than their stone counterparts, contributing to advances in agriculture, construction, and craftsmanship.</li>
                <li>Cultural and Technological Advancements: The use of bronze tools and weapons led to significant cultural and technological advancements. Cities were fortified with bronze weapons, and trade networks expanded as a result of the increased production of bronze artifacts. This era marked the transition from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age.</li>
